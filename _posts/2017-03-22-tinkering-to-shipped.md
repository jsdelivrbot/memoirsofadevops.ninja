# There's a fine line between tinkering and "it shipped".

My hypothesis is that a lifetime of using GUIs to copy and paste has taught us to duplicate code. Now that's a habit many of us have to unlearn to stay [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself).

A dev-ops ninja of mine pointed out that I might just be abusing the fine line between tinkering and "it shipped". It's fine to copy/paste code to a new directory to tinker with it, but then sometimes I forget to go back and do the (boooorrrrring) job of removing redundant code and refactoring. Maybe that fine line's not supposed to be so fine after all.

Hats off to the dev-ops ninja.

PS We should all be writing our webpages directly into github edit panels using voice dictation right now. __WTF__
